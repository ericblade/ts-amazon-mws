TypeScript types for use with Amazon MWS

Simple TypeScript conversion of the MWS documentation for all datatypes, see the varying sections at https://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_UK/subscriptions/Subscriptions_Datatypes.html

You can probably combine this with some sort of validation library to confirm that you are receiving expected data from MWS.  Keep in mind, that per MWS documentation, you must also be able to handle fields that aren't documented.

Should you find fields that are not listed here, or are listed correctly, please make a pull request to fix them, or file an Issue.

Thanks!  Be awesome!
